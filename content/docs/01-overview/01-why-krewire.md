# Why Krewire?

Modern software engineering is plagued by **toolchain fragmentation**. Building a production web service typically forces engineering teams to juggle three or four programming languages, disparate configuration formats, and disconnected build pipelines.

Krewire solves this problem by offering **Modular Go Libraries for Every Workload**.

---

## 1. The Problem: Toolchain Fragmentation

A typical web product lifecycle begins simply and quickly fractures as requirements expand:

```
Typical Modern Stack:
├── Web Frontend:    Node.js + npm + Vite/Webpack + React/Next.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)
├── Backend API:     Go (Gin/Fiber) or Python (FastAPI) or Ruby on Rails
├── Background Jobs: Python + Celery + Redis or Node + BullMQ
├── CLI Tooling:     Go (Cobra) or Rust (Clap)
├── Documentation:   Docusaurus or MkDocs or Hugo
└── Infrastructure:  Terraform/HCL or Pulumi or CloudFormation
```

### The Cost of Fragmentation

- **Context Switching:** Developers constantly bounce between JavaScript, Python, Go, and HCL syntaxes.
- **Dependency Hell:** A single `npm install` pulls thousands of unvetted third-party packages, creating security risks, breaking semver updates, and massive `node_modules` folders.
- **Incompatible Deployment Pipelines:** Frontends deploy to Vercel/Netlify; backends run in Docker containers on ECS/Kubernetes; workers run as separate worker processes; infra deploys via Terraform Cloud.
- **Rewrite Tax:** When a simple static site requires interactive features or backend APIs, teams are forced into expensive, risky architectural rewrites.

## 2. The Krewire Solution

Krewire unifies all of these workloads under **Go**, **`kiw`**, and **`krewire.yaml`**:

| Workload | Traditional Fragmented Approach | The Krewire Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static Site** | Node.js + Astro / Hugo / Next.js | `kiw build --site` (Go SSG, zero client JS) |
| **Documentation** | Docusaurus / GitBook / MkDocs | `kiw build --book` (`mdbind` markdown engine) |
| **Web Monolith** | Laravel / Django / Next.js + Node | `kiw run` (`packages/app` single Go binary) |
| **CLI & TUI** | Python Click / Node / Cobra | `kiw build --cli` (`packages/tui` reactive terminal) |
| **Background Jobs** | Celery + Python + Redis / Sidekiq | `kiw run --worker` (`packages/cloud/worker` queues & cron) |
| **Microservices** | Spring Boot / Express / Go kit | `kiw run --service` (`packages/cloud/service` gateway & OTel) |
| **Cloud Infra** | Terraform / HCL / CloudFormation | `kiw infra apply` (`packages/cloud/infra` Go IaC declarations) |
| **Client Frontend** | React / Vue / Angular + bundlers | `kiw build --wasm` (`packages/runtime` Go-to-WASM) |

## 3. The Three Pillars: Secure, Sustainable, Scalable

Krewire is not a monolithic framework — it is a suite of **modular Go libraries**
and an end-to-end **digital SDLC ecosystem**, from the first line of the specification (upstream) to production
operations and maintenance (downstream). Every capability it ships must pass
three pillars before it lands:

| Pillar | What it means | What it looks like in Krewire |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Secure** | Safety is the default, not an add-on or a paid tier. | Stdlib-first dependency graph, secure-by-default HTTP primitives, OWASP/CWE-aligned controls, `${env:NAME}` secrets, WASM sandboxing, and spec-traceable tests anyone can check. |
| **Sustainable** | A single builder can still read, run, and afford it a decade from now. | Single static binaries with embedded assets, opt-in batteries that cost zero when unused, boring proven parts, no license fees, and a learn-by-shipping community. |
| **Scalable** | Growth is additive, not a rewrite. | The progressive pipeline (below): each stage is an opt-in, reversible battery, so a $5 VPS product can reach hyperscale without being re-architected. |

These pillars are why "Why Krewire?" has a concrete answer for every stage of
the life cycle, not just for the code: one specification format, one config,
one CLI, and one language — from `docs/specs/` to `kiw deploy`.

## 4. Why Go as the Architectural Foundation?

Choosing Go is **architectural, not preferential**:

1. **Standard Library Completeness:**  
   Go's standard library (`net/http`, `html/template`, `embed`, `context`, `log/slog`, `flag`) provides production-grade networking, templating, and asset embedding out of the box. No external runtime or interpreter is required.
2. **True Static Single Binaries:**  
   A single `go build` produces a statically linked binary containing all compiled code, templates, and static assets. Startups occur in milliseconds with tiny memory footprints (10–30 MB RAM).
3. **One Tooling Gate:**  
   A single command pipeline (`gofmt`, `go vet`, `go test`) checks and formats every single workload in your repository—from the frontend SSG to the cloud infrastructure plans.
4. **Compile Speed & Concurrency:**  
   Go compiles in seconds and offers lightweight goroutines that can handle tens of thousands of concurrent network connections without thread exhaustion.
5. **No Virtual Machine or Interpreter Tax:**  
   Unlike Node.js or Python, Go does not require managing runtime environments (`nvm`, `venv`), avoiding version drift between local developer machines and production containers.

---

## 5. The Progressive Pipeline (`KWF-ARCH-P7L2Q`)

In Krewire, system growth is an **incremental upgrade**, not a rewrite. Your product evolves naturally through standardized pipeline stages:

```
[P0] Static Site / Book
       │
       ▼ (Add interactive WebAssembly islands)
[P1] Interactive Static (WASM Runtime)
       │
       ▼ (Add server routes, database, session auth)
[P2] Web Monolith (Single Binary App)
       │
       ▼ (Refactor into internal domain packages)
[P3] Modular Monolith (KWF-5ZHQV)
       │
       ▼ (Optional: Extract high-traffic modules)
[P4/P5] Extracted Workers & Microservices
       │
       ▼ (Automate cloud topology)
[P6] Cloud Infra & Service Mesh
```

### Why the Progressive Pipeline Matters

- **No File Moved Twice:** You never throw away code. Your `.kiw` components, layouts, and Go business logic carry forward intact from P0 to P6.
- **Reversible by Provider Swap:** A service module can run in-process within your modular monolith during development, and be extracted to a standalone service binary in production by simply adjusting configuration.
- **Zero Cost When Unused:** If your project only needs a static documentation site, the microservice and worker packages are not compiled into your output.

## 6. Summary

Krewire eliminates the cognitive overhead of modern web development. With one language, one CLI, and one unified configuration file, developers spend less time fighting build tools and more time shipping software.
